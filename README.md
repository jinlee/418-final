#418-final

This is the final project for 15-418. We'll be exploring ways to make javascript parallel.

We'll be doing this by using web workers and hacking on Mozilla's Spidermonkey.

###Getting Started

First get the correct build from Mozilla:

```
hg clone -r 177109 http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central your_dir_name
```

Note that to avoid errors, it's best to clone revision `177109`. This is the revision that we worked with. Also this part may take a while... There's a lot of code!

Now you can clone this repo, and put the js/ folder into the top level directory that you just created.

###Building

Soon...?
